Red River SQL Server User Group serves developers in and around the Shreveport-Bossier area. We meet the 3rd Wednesday of every month at the LSUS Technology Center. We will have free food and door prizes at each meeting, as well as a presentation on a topic relevant to SQL developers.

If you are interested in speaking at the RRSSUG, send an email to <rrssug@gmail.com> or contact us on Twitter [@rrssug](http://twitter.com/rrssug).
